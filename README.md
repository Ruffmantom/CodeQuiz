# CodeQuiz
making a quiz with HTML, CSS and Javascript

This README is for the purpose to showcase the work I have done to accomplish this homework. 
So I really wanted to show the process of how it all came together but I will have to update this read me when I get a chance. Im very pleased with how the program turned out, I just need to tweak a few bugs and fix some things that I would like to see.
Honestly this was the most code or logic we have done so far and uses everything pluss a little more that we have learned hah. Im glad to see the progress my brain is making in learning this lol.
